#### *As a Bachelor of Computer Engineering, I had to learn both, hardware and software, gaining experience and a deeper interest in these fields. Although I don't have working experience in front-end development, since I know several programming languages, I'm positive about quickly gaining the necessary skills for the job.*

### **Education**

  2020 – 2022
  
  **Ilia State University**
  
*New materials for Nano electronics and Nano Engineering — Master’s Program*

  
  Throughout the course I studied basics of quantum mechanics, optics and electronics, principles of Nano-engineering, Nano-electronics and influence of crystal cell frame on characteristics of the material.
*  02.2022 – 07.2022 I conducted research for my Masters’ Degree in RWTH Aachen University, Institute of Materials in Electrical Engineering 1 (IWE1), Aachen, Germany. Research topic was “Realization of an array of graphene 3D cylindrical architectures", which can possibly be used in plasmon based quantum computers.

2016 – 2020

**San-Diego State University - Georgia**

*Computer Engineering — Bachelor’s Program*


Throughout the course I studied multiple programming languages, computer architecture, designing, building and implementing logical and electrical circuits.
*  As a Senior Design project for Bachelors’ Degree my team worked on “Multi-Profile Abdominal Cavity Diagnostics Simulator”. Using Arduino Pro Micro as a controller, we collected data from air pressure sensors, distributed throughout the MOULAGE, and according to the predetermined symptoms computer program simulated reaction for further diagnostics. This device could be used as an inexpensive training tool for medical students.


*At San Diego State University in Georgia, all lectures were conducted in English, on the other hand, during my Master's studies, all materials were in English and since my stay in Germany, I had to communicate in English as well, I think, **I am proficient in this language***
